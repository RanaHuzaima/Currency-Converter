# Currency-Converter-App

🚀 Just wrapped up a productive morning! From 10:00 AM to 04:00 PM, Today I made this **Currency Converter App** with the help of **React**.

💡 I've learned so much about API how we handle APIs in React how data gets and is displayed on the user screen also interactive web applications.

🤓 Feeling accomplished and ready to tackle more JavaScript challenges. 💪🏽 Stay tuned for more coding adventures! 📚👩‍💻
